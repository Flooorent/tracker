# Tracker

Generic tracker that let's you track on a daily/weekly/monthly/yearly basis every recurring actions.

For instance:
- you need to make sure you study everyday after work for a career change ? Create a daily tracker !
- you are super busy and you "never find time" to see your friends at least every week for a beer ? Create a weekly tracker !
- you want to have your finances in order and stop overspending ? Create a monthly tracker !

The idea is to track things at a high level to see commitment. And have all those trackers at the same place.
We don't care about the little details, those are handled by over apps. We are here for the big picture.

Hope this helps !
